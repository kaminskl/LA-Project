              <p><em>When I think of art I think of beauty. Beauty is the mystery of life. It is not in the eye it is in the mind. In our minds there is awareness of perfection. </em> </p>
              <p><em> Someone recently asked me for my ‘secrets’ when it comes to how to make an abstract painting. This question got me thinking; how do you make an abstract painting that works? Naturally that’s partly down to the beholder, but for me there are definitely things that makes an abstract painting feel more successful.</em> </p>
              <p><em> I start with no reference image or clue as to what I’ll paint. After making marks and playing around with colour I start seeing things on the canvas, which I “make more visible”. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. So adding and removing is going on for a long while. Because abstract art doesn’t have a recognisable subject, the subject can become pure emotion. I recently made a painting while drinking wine and dancing, and I was in the most fabulous mood while doing so.</em></p>
            
             
             
              <p><em>I think there are facets to experiencing art. Of course each of us brings a unique experience to viewing a single work, so no two people will ever be looking at exactly the same thing, even when they’re looking at the same thing.
              Our beliefs, preferences, histories, and how we feel in a given moment will all have an effect on how we experience a work of art. We might even respond to the same piece differently at different times.
              One part of ‘reading a painting’ is about the technical language and skills used by the artist. Their choice of palette, marks, subject matter, composition and so on all weave together to create that initial impact.
              So the first touch is with the eyes.
              Eyes like to roam and brains like to make sense of things. If they can be kept occupied doing this, the soul can simply enjoy the experience of looking at a piece of art.
              As much as the soul wants to and must connect, it most often happens through the eyes first.</em></p>
